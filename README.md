# UnnamedFifedomGame
This is a little text based multiplayer game that can be hosted on a server and broadcast to your lan!

All you need to play is a browser and a linux server to host the game.

Unnamed Fifedom Gam is about battling for land, gathering resources, and out strategizing your friends. As of 12/3/2021, we have released a minimal working game that lacks many of the final features. Stay tuned!

You will need to install gotty before running the game using the command gotty -w python3 test.py
The default port is 8080

Enjoy! (More details coming soon!)
